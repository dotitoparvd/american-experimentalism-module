# Experimentalism and Politics in Early 20th-Century American Music

## Course Module Overview

This open‑source course module is designed for undergraduate music history classes. It explores the intersections of musical innovation, social consciousness, and political engagement in the United States during the first half of the twentieth century. Through the works of Charles Ives, Henry Cowell, and the Composers’ Collective of New York, students will examine how American composers challenged established European traditions, forged a distinctly American modernist idiom, and used music as a vehicle for political expression.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- Identify the core aesthetic and technical innovations of Charles Ives, Henry Cowell, and the Composers’ Collective of New York.
- Analyze how these composers’ works reflect broader social, philosophical, and political currents (e.g., transcendentalism, labor activism, anti‑fascism).
- Discuss the role of music in constructing an “American” artistic identity separate from European models.
- Engage with primary sources (manifestos, essays, scores) to develop critical close‑reading skills.
- Collaborate on digital humanities projects that extend the module’s content (e.g., curating listening lists, annotating historical documents).

## Key Figures Covered

- **Charles Ives** – Insurance executive and composer whose polytonal, polyrhythmic, and collage‑like works drew on hymn tunes, patriotic songs, and transcendentalist philosophy.
- **Henry Cowell** – Pianist, composer, and theorist who pioneered “tone clusters,” rhythmic complexity, and world‑music influences; founder of the *New Music Edition* and mentor to a generation of American experimentalists.
- **The Composers’ Collective of New York** – A group of left‑wing composers (including Marc Blitzstein, Elie Siegmeister, and others) who sought to create accessible, politically engaged music for the labor movement during the 1930s.

## Module Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `syllabus.md` – A three‑week syllabus with weekly topics, readings, and listening.
- `composer-profiles/` – Biographical sketches, key works, and discussions of social/political impact for each figure.
- `primary-sources/` (planned) – Excerpts from essays, manifestos, and other texts with guiding questions.
- `listening/` (planned) – Public‑domain recordings of the works studied.
